# ch13displayingChunksOfFile

Create a C++ project that asks the user for the name of a file. Be sure you use this fileDownload this file, named rj.txt, which has a line length of 60.. Display the first 8 lines of that file, then ask the user if they want to continue seeing chunks of the file. If they do, read and display the next 8 lines of the file. If they do not want to continue, stop reading the file, print "Bye", and close the program, with a pause so the user presses Enter to close the window. When the program reaches the end of the file, print "End Of File" and close the program, with a pause.so the user presses Enter to close the window (normal behavior).

Here is the result when the user says to stop displaying (it says "Bye"):

Here is the result when it reaches the end of file (it says "End of File").

Take screenshots of both results.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
